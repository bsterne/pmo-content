## Summary

This repo includes primarily the Content Security Policy documentation and unit tests that were in use prior to the W3C official repo coming online.  Interested parties should refer to the [official standard](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/content-security-policy/raw-file/tip/csp-specification.dev.html) as these docs are only preserved for posterity.
